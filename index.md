## About Me

Hello, I'm Howard / 蒋泓玮! I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I am fortunate to be mentored by Professor Xingguo Ming. My research is focused on the convergence of Industrial Software, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Human-AI Interaction.

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Professor Liang Gao on developing an optimization algorithm for the distribution of campus inspection vehicles, a project supported by the National College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program.

My research contributions have been recognized with publications in prestigious journals, including IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles, and Advanced Engineering Informatics. Additionally, I am an active member of ACM, CCF, and CAAI. For more details about my academic journey and achievements, please refer to my CV.

## Research Interests

- **Intelligent industrial software assisted by LLMs**: Taking the design and development of intelligent capabilities of industrial software (perception, cognition, decision-making, etc.) as the starting point, explore the application of cutting-edge LLMs and human-computer interaction technologies in the industrial field
- **Human-in-the-loop intelligent transportation system**: Social crowdsourcing intelligent transportation system platform mechanism design (order allocation mechanism, incentive, and reward mechanism); human factors of social crowdsourcing driver (risk preference, learning fairness)
- **Equipment reliability:** Intelligent fault diagnosis and equipment operation and maintenance, reliability modeling, allocation, and optimization methods
