## About Me

Hello, I'm Howard / 蒋泓玮! I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), where I am fortunate to be mentored by Professor Xingguo Ming. My research is focused on the convergence of Industrial Software, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Human-AI Interaction.

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Professor Liang Gao on developing an optimization algorithm for the distribution of campus inspection vehicles, a project supported by the National College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program.

## Research Interests

- **Intelligent industrial software assisted by LLMs**: Taking the design and development of intelligent capabilities of industrial software (perception, cognition, decision-making, etc.) as the starting point, explore the application of cutting-edge LLMs and human-computer interaction technologies in the industrial field
- **Human-in-the-loop intelligent transportation system**: Social crowdsourcing intelligent transportation system platform mechanism design (order allocation mechanism, incentive, and reward mechanism); human factors of social crowdsourcing driver (risk preference, learning fairness)
- **Equipment reliability:** Intelligent fault diagnosis and equipment operation and maintenance, reliability modeling, allocation, and optimization methods

## News

- **[July. 2024]** Excited to start an academic trip in Huhhot with the ChineseCSCW community!
- **[Jan. 2024]** Our paper about reliability in component allocation problem is accepted to AEI.
- **[Dec. 2023]** Our paper about crowdsourcing logistics platform is accepted to IEEE TITS.
- **[Sept. 2021]** Started my Ph.D. at SJTU!
